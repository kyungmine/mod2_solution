		 	<p>'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
            So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
			Shoes on, get up in the morn'
			Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
			King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
			Sing song when I'm walking home
			Jump up to the top, LeBron
			Ding dong, call me on my phone
			Ice tea and a game of ping pong, huh
			This is getting heavy
			Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)

			Finally, you found yourself a friend

			Ever since the start
			I saw the end around the corner
			'Cause I know you so well
			So predictable
			You're an animal
			I can't let you go
			You're so good at being bad, you know
			So predictable
			You're an animal
			I can't let you go
			You're so good at being bad (uh)

			  	Hello, how are you?
				It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
				I hope that you're well
				Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
				It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
				So hello from the other side (Other side)
				I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
				To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
				But when I call, you never seem to be home
				Hello from the outside (Outside)
				</p>
